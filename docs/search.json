    "text": "Quantifying Secondhand Aerosol Exposure to HCWs During Nebulization\n\nSkills: Bench modeling, UV spectroscopic, SPSS, Graph Pad Prism, study design.\nDate: September, 2025\nLink: https://shorturl.at/hg5TX\n\n\n\nOverview\nIn a climate-controlled ICU room, we quantified inhaled dose and ambient particle concentrations to estimate health-care worker (HCW) exposure to fugitive aerosols during nebulization.\n\n\nMethods\n\nSet-up: Patient + two HCW adult airway models at 1 ft and 3 ft; ventilator-driven spontaneous breathing.\nInterface: Aerosol mask (mouth-breathing), tracheostomy mask, T-piece.\nDrug Delivery: Albuterol via jet nebulizer (2 sessions; 30 mg total over 30 minutes).\nMeasurements: Inhaled drug on filters (UV at 276 nm), continuous particle counts at both distances; repeated trials with 30-min room reset.\n\n\n\nKey Results\n\nHCW inhaled dose ~0.1–0.3% of nominal across interfaces/distances; highest with trach mask.\nHigher particle concentration at 1 ft than 3 ft for trach mask; strong linear correlation between inhaled dose and 1-ft aerosol levels (r²≈0.79).\nFindings suggest low but non-negligible exposure; call for in-vivo/long-term risk assessment."

    "section": "My Journey",
    "text": "My Journey\nI shifted from bedside care to research after seeing how under-researched or controversial practices can shape outcomes. Since then, I’ve led or co-authored 11+ projects—from systematic reviews and meta-analyses to prospective cohorts, randomized cross-over trials, and bench studies—centered on critical-care therapies such as HFNC, prone positioning, and aerosol delivery. I work across international teams, pairing rigorous study design with analytics (SPSS, R, Prism) to generate evidence that improves practice and mentors the next generation of respiratory therapists. Pursuing the PhD in Clinical Translational Science at Case Western Reserve University is how I’m turning that mission into sustained impact."
