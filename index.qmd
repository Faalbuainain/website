## About Me

I’m Fai Ali Albuainain, a Registered Respiratory Therapist and PhD candidate in Clinical Translational Science at Case Western Reserve University. I focus on improving respiratory disease management, with interests spanning aerosol medicine, ventilatory support, and health disparities. 

## What I'm Doing Now

- Investigating how social determinants of health relate to quality of life and outcomes in patients with asthma.
- Exploring the role of large language models (LLMs) in respiratory medicine.
- Conducting bench studies on aerosol delivery using vibrating mesh nebulizers under various ventilation modes.
